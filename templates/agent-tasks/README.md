# Agent Task Contracts

Task Contracts define work. They do not define which executor must perform it.

Supported modes:

- `IMPLEMENT` — code or documentation changes explicitly allowed by the task scope.
- `TEST_ONLY` — validation and reporting only; writable paths are limited to `docs/agent-results/**`.
- `REVIEW_ONLY` — inspection, analysis, and reporting only; writable paths are limited to `docs/agent-results/**`.

Any compatible executor (Codex, ZCode, Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness, or another platform) may execute any mode if the Task Contract authorizes it. Executor choice never changes mode semantics.

## Active task

The canonical active task is:

`docs/agent-tasks/ACTIVE_TASK.json`

It is machine-readable and authoritative. `ACTIVE_TASK.md` may exist only as a non-authoritative human companion.

Do not create an ACTIVE task during workflow installation.

Run `agent-workflow doctor --json` before execution. If the result is BLOCKED, keep the ACTIVE task and the blocked Result Contract. When the missing capability is available, run `agent-workflow task resume`; the CLI preserves prior evidence and opens a numbered attempt Result path.

If the active task is missing or invalid, the executor must stop instead of inferring work from chat history, old reports, issues, source code, or another executor's files.

## Generate a task

With the CLI:

```bash
agent-workflow task create \
  --mode TEST_ONLY \
  --objective "Run the targeted release retest" \
  --validate "npm test" \
  --accept "All required checks are reported" \
  --companion
```

The generator attempts to read the current Git branch. Unless `--source-commit` is supplied explicitly, it writes `source_commit: LATEST`, meaning the executor resolves the current tip of `source_branch` after pulling/fetching and records the exact SHA used in the Result Contract.

This default is deliberate: the ACTIVE task is normally committed to the same branch, so pinning the task to the pre-task HEAD would become stale as soon as the task itself is committed. Use `--source-commit <SHA>` only when execution must be intentionally pinned to an immutable revision.

When a local Git HEAD is available, the generator records it as `metadata.prepared_from_commit` for audit without treating it as the execution pin.

For `IMPLEMENT`, at least one `--allow` path is required. `TEST_ONLY` and `REVIEW_ONLY` are machine-enforced as result-only write modes under `docs/agent-results/**`.

The generator refuses to replace an existing ACTIVE task and validates the generated JSON before making it active.

## Manual template

`TEMPLATE_TASK.json` is a schema-valid platform-neutral scaffold for cases where a task is authored without the CLI. Replace every placeholder with repository-specific facts before activating it.

## Source of authority

Permissions come only from the active Task Contract, especially:

- `mode`;
- `source_branch` and `source_commit`;
- `objective` and `context`;
- `allowed_changes`;
- `forbidden_changes`;
- `validation`;
- `acceptance_criteria`;
- `result_contract`;
- `completion_commit_contract`.

Executor adapters may document platform-specific startup or environment details, but they must not grant or remove task permissions.
